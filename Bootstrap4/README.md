# Bootstrap package

This package is based on the [Bootstrap 4 framework](http://getbootstrap.com/). In order to use it you need to add the package to the `ResourcePackages folder` of your project. If the `ResourcePackages` folder doesn't contain any packages, widget templates will be loaded from Embedded resources or from the MVC folder of SitefinityWebApp (if this folder contains files with names, matching the naming convention). Templates from the source of Embedded resources have lowest loading priority. Templates in the MVC folder of SitefinityWebApp are with higher priority, and templates from a package have highest loading priority.

## Npm
### Install
Npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the worldâ€™s largest software registry. For more information visit [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) website
```
> npm install
> npm start
```
`npm start` executes the default npm scritps and watches for any changes in the files after that.

## Package structure

The Bootstrap package contains front-end assets, widget template, grid widget templates and grunt configuration. Below are listed some of the folders and files.
 - **assets** - contains front-end files such as CSS, JS, images and  SVG sprites
 	- **dist** - contains the processed ready-to-use front-end assets
 		- **css** - contains the processed css files
 			- **main.css** - this is output of the processed `main.scss` from `assets/src/project/sass`. This file contains Sitefinity, Bootstrap and project css
 			- **main.min.css** - this is the same as `main.css` but minified. This is the distributed css file which is linked in the package Razor layout file `MVC/Views/Layouts/default.cshtml`
        - **sprites** - contains SVG sprites for sitefinity icons. These are [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) SVG sprites.
        - **images** - contains compressed images from project src folder which are usually used as background images in the css.
        - **js** - contains the js files (`bootstrap.min.js` and `poper.min.js`) that are required for the proper use of the Bootstrap framework. These file are linked in the package Razor layout file `MVC/Views/Layouts/default.cshtml`
 	- **src** - contains the source front-end files which are processed to dist folder
        - **sitefinity** - contains scss files for Sitefinity styling
 		- **project** - add your non-sitefinity front-end assets here
 			- **sprites** - add sprite files here to be moved to `assets/dist/sprites`. You will need to extend/replace the files paths listed in `package.json` file in `config.copySprites` section.
 			- **images** - add images here. Images added in this folder will be compressed and output to `assets/dist/images`
 			- **js** - add js files here to be moved to `assets/dist/js`. You will need to extend/replace the file paths listed in `package.json` file in `config.copyJs` section.
 			- **sass** - create subfolders in this folder and add your scss files here
 				- **main.scss** - import all your scss files here. This file will be processed to `assets/dist/css/main.min.css`
        ```
        File structure example:
        | ResourcePackages
        |-- Bootstrap
        |---- assests
        |------ dist
        |------ src
        |-------- sitefinity
        |-------- project
        |---------- sprites
        |---------- images
        |---------- js
        |---------- sass
        |------------ main.scss
        ```
        **! It is NOT recommended to rename the subfolders because they are used in npm scripts !**
 - **MVC folder** - contains all widget templates categorized by widget and the Razor layout file
 	- **Layouts/default.cshtml** - Razor layout file
 - **GridSystem** - contains grid widget templates
 - **package.json** - stores metadata that the project needs and all the npm scripts that are use for the build

## Editing and creating a widget
By default we include all widget templates in every package. Modifying a template is super easy. If you want to modify the Pills navigation template, just go to `/ResourcePackages/Bootstrap4/MVC/Views/Navigation`, open the `NavigationView.Pills.cshtml` file and make your changes.

Creating a new template is just as easy. Duplicate an existing template, give a name to the new file, keeping in mind the following structure - `NavigationView.XXXXXX.cshtml`. Then the new template will appear in the list of templates for this widget in the widget designer in Page editor.

For widgets that have list and details views, the structure should be `List.XXXXXX.cshtml` or `Detail.XXXXXX.cshtml`, respectively.

To create a new widget template for Dynamic content first create a folder with the name of the dynamic module in singular where you have organized the project widget templates (`/Mvc/Views/` or `/ResourcePackages/Bootstrap4/MVC/Views`). After that create a `*.cshtml` files having in mind the structure described above `List.XXXXXX.cshtml` for list view and `Detail.XXXXXX.cshtml` for details view and write the markup of the template.
When you create a new Dynamic module list and details widget templates are automatically created for this module in `Design > Widget Templates` in Sitefinity Backend. As a starting point, you can use the template from Sitefinity Backend and make the desired changes on the file system.

## Editing and creating a grid widget
By default we include the most popular column combinations as grid widgets. Modifying a grid widget template is super easy. If you want to modify the grid widget with two equal columns go to `/ResourcePackages/Bootstrap4/GridSystem/Templates`, open `grid-6+6.html` and make your changes.
You can add an extra CSS class to a column, change the label of the field for adding CSS classes for this column in the grid widget designer in Page editor or change the name of a column's placeholder name in Page editor.

**Example:**
```
<div class="row" data-sf-element="Row">
    <div class="sf_colsIn col-lg-6 **EXTRA_CSS_CLASS**" data-sf-element="**NEW_COLUMN_1_CSS_CLASS_FIELD_LABEL**" data-placeholder-label="**NEW_COLUMN_1_PLACEHOLDER_NAME**">
    </div>
    <div class="sf_colsIn col-lg-6" data-sf-element="Column 2" data-placeholder-label="Column 2">
    </div>
</div>
```
Don't remove `sf_colsIn`. It is a system css classed which indicates where a placeholder will be created.

Creating a new grid widget is just as easy.
Duplicate an existing grid widget template, give a name to the new file. Then the new grid widget will appear in the list of grid widgets in the Layout tab in Page editor.

**Example:** To create a simple placeholder with `<section>` tag create `section.html` in `/ResourcePackages/Bootstrap4/GridSystem/Templates/`
```
	<section class="section" data-sf-element="Section" data-placeholder-label="Section">
	</section>
```

## Widget templates management recommendations

### Modifying widget templates

To make upgrades easier we recommend not to change default widget templates. If you need to make changes to a default template it is better to create a new one by duplicating the one you want to change and make the changes on the new one.

### Where to put project templates

If you want to have the project's widget templates separated from the default widget templates you can place them in the MVC folder in the root `SitefinityWebApp` folder of your project `/Mvc/Views/`. It is easier to navigate and manage less files. The same can be done with grid widget templates. Project specific grid widget templates can be moved to `/GridSystem/Templates` in the root `SitefinityWebApp` folder of the project.

## Responsive design ##

The responsiveness of the widgets and grid widgets rely solely on Bootstrap. The goal is to integrate the frameworks in the best possible way so that everyone can take advantage of the responsive features of the framework.

An exception is made for the Navigation widget. There is a possibility to transform the navigation into a `<select>`.

In the navigation widget templates (e.g. `/ResourcePackages/Bootstrap4/MVC/Views/Navigation/NavigationView.Horizontal.cshtml`) there is a helper method `@Html.Action("GetView", new { viewName = "Dropdown",  model= Model})` which renders the `<select>`. It's commented out by default, but if you want to, you can use it with combination with the responsive utility classes of Bootstrap.
If you decide to use it, you can modify its markup in the `/ResourcePackages/Bootstrap4/MVC/Views/Navigation/Dropdown.cshtml` file.

## Where to put project front-end assets
All project specific front-end assets like scss, images, js, sprites, etc. should be placed in `assets/src/project`. When the `npm start` is run all source files are processed and moved to `assets/dist` from where there are used in the project.

### Scss
Place all your scss files in `assets/src/project/sass`. We recommend to create subfolders to organize the project's files and then import them in `main.scss`
**Example:**
```
File structure
|- sass
|-- settings
|--- _colors.scss
|--- _typography.scss
...
|-- base
|--- _link.scss
|--- _typography.scss
...

main.scss
//Import Bootstrap from npm
@import "../../../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
@import "../../../../node_modules/magnific-popup/src/css/main";

// Sitefinity
@import "../../sitefinity/sass/sitefinity";

//Import .scss files here
...
```
When you run `npm start` all scss files imported in `assets/src/project/sass/main.scss` will be processed and output in `assets/dist/css/main.css`
If you don't want to include Sitefinity or Bootstrap css or you want to use another Bootstrap version change the import rule `@import "../../sitefinity/sass/sitefinity.scss";` or `@import "../../../../node_modules/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss";` in `assets/src/project/sass/main.scss`.
### Images
Place all images in `assets/src/project/images`. After `npm start` is run all images from this folder will be compressed and moved to `assets/dist/images`.

### Javascript
List all your js files (separated by space) that you want to be moved to `assets/dist/js` in `packages.json -> config.copyJs` section.

**packages.json**
```
...,
"config": {
    "copyJs": "... assets/src/project/js/project-file-1.js assets/src/project/js/project-file-2.js"
  }
```

**Example:** To load `project-file-1.js` open the project Razor layout file (`/ResourcePackages/Bootstrap4/MVC/Views/Layouts/default.cshtml`) and add a reference there.
```
	@Html.Script(Url.Content("~/ResourcePackages/Bootstrap4/assets/dist/js/project-file-1.js"), "bottom")
```

### SVG sprites
Following the suggestion given by the [Bootstrap 4 framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/migration/#components) we use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) SVG sprites for our icons. After `npm start` is run these sprites can be located in `assets/dist/sprites`. If more sprites are needed to be loaded, list them (separated by space) like following in the `package.json -> config.copySprits` scetion

**packages.json**
```
...,
"config": {
    "copySprites": "... assets/src/project/sprites/sprite-1.svg assets/src/project/sprites/sprite-2.svg ",
  }
```

**Example:** To use SVG icon in widget template add a reference there like this: (`solid.svg` is the sprite and `#book` is the [icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/book?style=solid))
```
    <svg>
        <use class="sf-icon-right" xlink:href="~/ResourcePackages/Bootstrap4/assets/dist/sprites/solid.svg#book"></use>
    </svg>
```
